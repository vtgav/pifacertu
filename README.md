DNP3 Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) based on opendnp3 (dnp3.github.com) and the raspberry Pi + Piface.

1. Build and install opendnp3 on the Pi or via cross compiler (http://dnp3.github.com)
2. Build and install libpiface-1.0 (https://github.com/thomasmacpherson/piface)
3. Build piface rtu:

```
$ autoreconf -i -f
$ ./configure CXXFLAGS=-O2
$ make
$ ./pifacertu
```

By default, the RTU listens on port 20000. Master address is 1, outstation address is 1024. You can change these in the source
or setup some command line arguments. Pull requests happily accepted =).

ControlRelayOutputBlock requests can be sent to indices 0 to 7 with LATCH_ON or LATCH_OFF.

| Index         | Function        |
| ------------- |:---------------:|
| 0             | Relay 1 + LED1  |
| 1             | Relay 2 + LED2  |
| 2             | LED3            |
| 3             | LED4            |
| 4             | LED5            |
| 5             | LED6            |
| 6             | LED7            |
| 7             | LED8            |


Switches 1-4 are mapped to BinaryInput indices 0-3

| Index         | Function        |
| ------------- |:---------------:|
| 0             | Switch1         |
| 1             | Switch2         |
| 2             | Switch3         |
| 3             | Switch4         |

GDR
1. Added simulated a( randmised ) analog input value on analog input 0 ( with timestamp )
2. Also, extended dig inputs to cover all 8 available

Enjoy!
